#  Advanced Interview Project

## Introduction
This project was created to help evaluate both your XCUITest and debugging skills. Please clone the project and start building out your tests!

## Your Mission Should You Decide to Choose It
1. Get the project prepared for testing
2. Build the project locally
3. Debug issues you might encounter while running the app 
4. Create tests based off of functionality

## Setup
To be able to test one of the views in the project, you'll need to go and get an API key from Giphy. It's a really easy process and should only take a minute. Please go to this [link](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide) for instructions.

Once you have your API key, you'll now need to add it to the project. Please go to the file named "TenorSetup" and add your API key to the stored property named "apiKey". The last thing you'll need to do is rename the "TenorSetup" struct to "Tenor". Now you should be all setup and ready to go.

## Instructions
You'll notice the app has three views. Please write both functional and unit tests for all three of them. More indepth instructions can be found here. Do not push changes back up to the repo. We will go over your tests during the interview.

## Bonus Points
1. Fix the warnings displayed in Xcode
2. Is it possible to add unit tests? If yes; do you want to try adding them?
